# TNBC Multi-Omics (Bhaskararao Ch)

End-to-end analysis of *Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)* using RNA-seq, DNA methylation, mutations/TMB, and proteomics.  
Multi-omics are integrated via *Similarity Network Fusion (SNF)* + *consensus clustering, validated by **survival* (KM/Cox) and *pathway* enrichment (GO/GSVA/PROGENy).  
Model *explainability* is provided with *SHAP*.

## Highlights
- *Integration:* SNF + consensus → stable TNBC subtypes
- *Biology:* GO/Reactome enrichment; GSVA panels; PROGENy TF activity
- *Outcomes:* Kaplan–Meier & age-adjusted Cox confirm prognostic separation
- *Explainability:* SHAP summaries + feature prep scripts
