# TNBC Multi-Omics (Bhaskararao Ch)

This repository contains a *multi-omics integration pipeline for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)*.  
i combined *transcriptomic (RNA-seq), epigenomic (methylation), genomic (mutations), and proteomic/pathway activity data* using *Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) and consensus clustering*.  
The analysis identified patient subgroups linked to survival outcomes, explored pathways through enrichment/GSVA, validated with external GEO cohorts, and added explainability via SHAP.

*Key Features*
- RNA-seq differential expression (DEGs)  
- Methylation differential analysis (DMPs)  
- Mutation profiling and driver analysis  
- Proteomic/GSVA pathway panels  
- SNF + consensus clustering integration  
- Kaplan–Meier & Cox survival analysis  
- External validation (GEO)  
- SHAP explainability plots
